Blocknative offers real-time data feeds for monitoring in-flight Blockchain transactions. Users can set up custom webhooks which emit events when transactions become pending or successful/failed. This allows our developers to respond to blockchain events in real-time, triggering complex scripts whenever a user interacts with the blockchain. For example, dynamic reveals can take place which do not reveal the metadata until the token is minted.

## Setting Up a Blocknative Account

Navigate to [blocknative.com](https://www.blocknative.com/) and create an account by clicking the `Explore the Mempoool` button in the upper right. You'll be prompted to input your information.

## Purchasing a Subscription

You can navigate to [their plans](https://www.blocknative.com/pricing#compareplans) via `Products` to view the three types of subscriptions that Blocknative offers. Generally, it is advised to utilize the `Production` level subscription, however, in limited, low-traffic environments, one could potentially use the Prototype package.

## API Keys

Once the subscription has been purchased, or a free subscription setup, then you can navigate to the [account page](https://explorer.blocknative.com/account). This will allow you to `Add new API key` along the right-hand side, prompting you to input a name. The key will then appear below, and can be sent to your developer, allowing them to utilize the Blocknative SDK to see blockchain transactions in real time.

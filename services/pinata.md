Pinata IPFS provides a gateway to the IPFS network, allowing useres to upload and fetch content "with blazing speeds thanks to Dedicated Gateways".

## Setting Up an Account

To set up an account, visit [pinata.cloud](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and navigate to the `Get started` link in the upper right. From there, you'll be able to sign up via email and password.

## Plan Offerings

Pinata offers a number of plans. Generally, for a single project the most preferred plan is the `Picnic` plan, as it provides access to 20,000 pinned files, and increased bandwidth for monthly usage. The `Picnic` plan also scales with usage, ensuring your project will not experience downtime in the event your usage exceeds the preset limits.

## API Keys

Once you've purchased your `Pinata` subscription, you'll navigate to `API Keys` along the right hand menu. This will allow you to `+ New Key` (in the upper right) to create the key your developer will need to access the API via `Pinata's` designated API. See below the `API Keys` tab:

For the purposes of pr0xy, please supply an `Admin` key by toggling the `Admin` slider. Label the key something descriptive, use only lower case letters and no spaces - dashes or underscores are fine. See the below for an example:

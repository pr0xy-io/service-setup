## Plan Offerings

Pinata offers a number of plans. Generally, for a single project the most preferred plan is the `Picnic` plan, as it provides access to 20,000 pinned files, and increased bandwidth for monthly usage. The `Picnic` plan also scales with usage, ensuring your project will not experience downtime in the event your usage exceeds the preset limits.

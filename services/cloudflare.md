## Signing Up for Cloudflare

One can navigate to [cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and `Sign up` in the upper right for an account. Once finished, it is advisable to share this organization with your developer. This can be done by going to `Manage Account` in the menu on the left-hand side, and clicking members. Then adding a member via the `Invite` button.
